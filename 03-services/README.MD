Communication Flow with LoadBalancer Service
When an external user wants to access an application exposed by a LoadBalancer Service in Kubernetes, the request goes through the following sequence:

External Client: The external user makes a request using the LoadBalancer's DNS name or external IP.

LoadBalancer: The request is first received by the LoadBalancer, which distributes the incoming traffic across the available nodes in the cluster.

NodePort:

The LoadBalancer forwards the request to one of the Nodes (Node A, Node B, or Node C) on a specific NodePort (e.g., 30001).
The LoadBalancer essentially connects to the NodePort on the selected node.
ClusterIP:

The NodePort Service then routes the traffic to the ClusterIP Service associated with it. This is an internal service that is used to communicate with the Pods.
The ClusterIP is essentially the internal virtual IP of the Service that is routing traffic to the Pods.
Pod: Finally, the request reaches the appropriate Pod(s) that are handling the application. The Pods are selected based on the labels and selectors defined in the Service manifest.
